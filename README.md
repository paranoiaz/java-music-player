# Java Music Player
A music player with a clean design made in Java using JavaFX for the GUI components.

**Dependencies**

**Notes**

Before running make sure to provide a valid path to a directory with the audio files you want to play. Currently only supports a single playlist but feel free to expand on this using the class Playlist and your own components.
```java
Playlist playlist = new Playlist("playlist name", "path/to/directory");
```
